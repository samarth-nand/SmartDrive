# SmartDrive
Starter Code for SmartDrive

The program will simulate reading sensor data, display the data to the console, and prompt you to press Enter to refresh the data.

## Customizing the Simulation

While this project uses mock data to simulate sensor inputs, it can be adapted to integrate with actual hardware by modifying the `sensor.c` file to include hardware-specific data acquisition logic. Ensure to link with any necessary libraries or SDKs for your hardware when compiling.

## Dependencies

This project does not depend on external libraries or frameworks beyond the standard C library. Ensure your development environment includes a C compiler and standard development tools.
